                                <li><span>&lt;header&gt;</span> - Contains the navigation bar with links to different pages like "Team," "Sitemap," "Profile," etc. The website's logo is also placed here.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> - Holds the navigation links inside the header, allowing users to move between different sections of the website.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;main&gt;</span> - Contains the main content of the homepage, including success statistics, mission, vision, and content tiles.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;section&gt;</span> - Used to divide the page into different sections, such as Mission, Vision, and 90% Success! Each section has a heading and descriptive text.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;div&gt;</span> - Used multiple times for layout and styling, such as wrapping images, aligning text, and creating a structured design.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;h2&gt;</span> - Defines headings for different sections like "Our Mission," "Our Vision," and "90% Success!" to highlight important content.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;footer&gt;</span> - Contains copyright information and a link to the page editor, ensuring that users can access footer details at the bottom of the page.</li>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>
                            For the homepage, I focused on ensuring accessibility through a few key design and functionality choices. To improve readability for users with visual impairments, I used high contrast colors between the text and background. The navigation bar is structured with the <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> tag, which aids in clear navigation for both screen readers and keyboard users. The sticky navigation ensures that users can always easily access important links no matter where they are on the page.  
                            <br>
                            I also used the <span>&lt;section&gt;</span> tag to divide the content into distinct parts such as the mission, vision, and success statistics, making it easier for screen readers to identify and navigate between different sections. The use of <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> tags helps with layout and positioning without cluttering the page, making it more digestible.  
                            <br>
                            For readability, I chose a clean, simple font and ensured good line spacing, which benefits users with dyslexia and other cognitive challenges. These design decisions enhance the user experience, making the website accessible to a wider audience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <ul style="color: black;">
                                <li><span>&lt;header&gt;</span> - The header contains the navigation bar with links to different pages such as "Home," "Team," "Sitemap," and "Profile," providing clear navigation for the user. The logo is also placed here for branding purposes.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> - The navigation bar inside the <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> tag helps users easily navigate between sections like "Home," "Team," "Profile," and others. Itâ€™s structured for both keyboard and screen reader users, allowing easy access to all pages.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;table&gt;</span> - The <span>&lt;table&gt;</span> tag is used to display event details in a structured way, including the date, category, progress, and status of various beach cleanup activities. It helps in organizing data in rows and columns for better clarity.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;thead&gt;</span> - The <span>&lt;thead&gt;</span> element is used to define the header row of the table. It contains the titles of the columns such as "Category," "Progress," and "Status."</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;tbody&gt;</span> - The <span>&lt;tbody&gt;</span> section holds the content of the table, displaying details about each event like the date, beaches cleaned, volunteers, and the amount of plastic removed.</li>
                                <li><span>&lt;footer&gt;</span> - The footer contains copyright information and a link to the page editor, ensuring users can easily access footer details at the bottom of the page.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>
                            To improve accessibility, I focused on clear and simple design choices. For users with visual impairments, I ensured high contrast between the text and the background for better readability. The navigation bar, structured using the <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> tag, helps screen readers and keyboard users easily navigate the site, ensuring no section is missed. The sticky navigation keeps key links always visible for quick access.  
                            <br>
                            The <span>&lt;table&gt;</span> structure helps organize the content neatly, making it easier for screen readers to identify each section of the table. The use of <span>&lt;thead&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;tbody&gt;</span> ensures that screen readers can differentiate between headings and data rows. Additionally, I used high contrast colors for important sections like "Completed" and "Ongoing" to help users quickly identify status.  
                            <br>
                            To enhance readability for users with cognitive or learning difficulties, I used a simple font and appropriate line spacing to prevent content from feeling crowded. These decisions make the website more accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.

                        <p>
                            <ul style="color: black;">
                                <li>For the technical aspects of this webpage, I ensured proper HTML structure by using semantic tags such as <span>&lt;header&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;main&gt;</span>, and <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>. These elements provide a clear document structure, which is essential for both search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The <span>&lt;header&gt;</span> houses the navigation bar, allowing for consistent access to key pages. The <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> tag further improves accessibility by defining a navigation block for assistive technologies.</li>
                                <li>In terms of layout and design, I used the <span>&lt;section&gt;</span> tag to group related content, making it easier for screen readers to identify different parts of the webpage. This provides clear landmarks for users to jump between sections. Additionally, <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> elements are used strategically to structure content without cluttering the page, aiding in a clean and efficient layout.</li>
                                <li>To enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments, I used high contrast colors for text and background elements. This improves readability for users with low vision or color blindness. I also ensured the use of larger, easy-to-read fonts, with proper line spacing to improve readability for users with dyslexia or cognitive challenges.</li>
                                <li>For mobile users, the website is fully responsive. Through the use of media queries in the CSS, the layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The sticky navigation bar remains visible as users scroll, ensuring easy access to important links at all times.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    
                    

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                            In terms of accessibility, I focused on making the website usable for a wide range of users, including those with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities. For readability, I used high contrast between text and background colors, ensuring clear visibility. I also chose a simple, legible font and ensured good line spacing, which is helpful for users with dyslexia or cognitive challenges.
                            <br>
                            To improve navigation for screen reader users, I utilized semantic HTML tags such as <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;main&gt;</span>, and <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>. The <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> element makes the navigation links clearly defined, allowing for easier interaction with assistive technologies. The <span>&lt;header&gt;</span> houses the main navigation, ensuring users can always access important pages no matter where they are on the site.
                            <br>
                            Additionally, I used the <span>&lt;section&gt;</span> tag to group content logically, providing clear landmarks for screen readers. The use of <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> elements also helped with layout without adding unnecessary complexity to the page. 
                            <br>
                            Finally, for mobile users, the website adapts through responsive design. This ensures that users across different devices can access the content without any issues, whether on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

                <p>
                    Building the website came with its challenges, especially ensuring it was responsive across devices and accessible to all users. The navigation bar needed to be easy to use for both screen readers and keyboard users, which led to using semantic HTML tags like <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;section&gt;</span>. 
                    <br>
                    The table page required careful design to ensure data was displayed clearly and was accessible. Testing across devices taught me the importance of making sure everything works smoothly, no matter the screen size. 
                    <br>
                    Overall, I learned the value of simple, clear design and accessibility, making the website usable for a wider audience, including those with visual impairments or cognitive challenges.

                    <p>
                        The pages I've created follow Janet's web accessibility regulations by ensuring all content is easily navigable, usable, and accessible. For the homepage, table, and content pages, I used semantic HTML tags like <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;section&gt;</span> to improve readability for screen readers. Additionally, all text has a high contrast against the background to benefit users with visual impairments.
                        <br>
                        The table page is organized to ensure data is clearly structured, and I made sure links are easily accessible and functional, even for keyboard users. The CSS ensures responsive design, adapting to various screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on mobile devices. 
                        <br>
                        I also ensured that multimedia content, like images, has alt text to describe them for visually impaired users, which aligns with Janet's accessibility standards. These choices demonstrate my commitment to creating an accessible, compliant website.
