                        <br> The tags and elements that control the functionality of the webpage through its code and layout are captured through the following meta tags and elements. The page character should be encoded through the tag `"meta charset="UTF-8"> which allows for the use of several different languages and special characters as a unit through the support of UTF-8 encoding. When a user accesses the webpage through devices with different screen sizes, for instance, mobile devices or tablets, the viewport meta tag `"meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, height=device-width,initial-scale=1.0”>`makes the website responsive so adjustments can be made. The page zoom level is also determined through the `initial-scale=1.0` portion of the meta tag, which ensures the page loads at the default zoom level. The page title displayed on the tab of the browser is determined through `Splash Screen`, which is established in the domain tag `<title>Splash Screen</title>`. The style of the webpage is linked through the internal CSS file named `style.css` by the webpage link tag  `""link rel=”stylesheet” href=”style.css”>`. As a splash screen which displays while the main content is loading, the user is redirected to the webpage `TextOverWriteWebsiteVideoLooping.html` after 4 seconds through the meta tag `""meta http-equiv=”refresh” content=” 4;url=TextOverWriteWebsiteVideoLooping.html""">`.</br>

                    <p>The Marine Life Web Page I created adheres to Janet's regulations regarding publication by ensuring user accessibility, usability, security, and proper ethical content usage. The page follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines which makes it usable by all, including people with disabilities. For example, all marine images have rote alt text, allowing screen users to understand the content instead of them being visually impaired. The webpage has a logical flow and structure with appropriately carved out headings that allow users to navigate easily towards different marine species, conservation efforts, and ocean-related topics.

                        In security, the website provides HTTPS encryption which assists in protecting user data and ensuring safe browsing. When a user interacts with the website and subscribes or fills out contact forms, data protection measures are in place which helps in compliance privacy regulations. Also, all images and content used on the page are either original and royalty free or properly attributed which assists in compliance with the copyright laws. Performance optimization also comes with the page, offering compressed images as well as well structured coded which improves loading times aiding in enhanced user experience. To summarize, the marine life webpage incorporates Janet’s standards by being informative, secure, and allows a wide audience to access the page effortlessly.
